<body><h2> What are the Symptoms?</h2>
      <p1> -Memory Loss: This is the main symptom of Alzheimer’s. Low levels of Neurotransmitter and Acetylcholine is the reason 
        why different areas of the brain shrink. This is the main reason of memory loss.</p1>

      <p1>  -Thinking and Reasoning: In Alzheimer’s, a person’s thinking and reasoning abilities are deeply affected by the
        disease. These changes occur because of the damage and deterioration of brain cells in a particular area that is
        responsible for memory, thinking, and problem-solving.</p1>  
  <br>
  <hr>
      <p1>  -Change in Personality and Behavior: These include mood swings, depression, anxiety, aggression, and
        irritability.</p1>
  <hr>
      <p1>  -Delusion: People with Alzheimer’s might be suspicious of others plotting against them and trying to harm them.
        They might also believe that their belonging are being stolen.</p1>
